CodeIgniter History Library
=============================================================

Actions history management library for CodeIgniter. 

Instead of using built-in hooks mechanism available in CodeIgniter like other similar libraries
I have taken different approach which allows developer to reinitialize the history 
couple of times during on workflow which gives much more flexibility. The footprint is really small
so it doesn't really affect the overall performance of your application.

You can load it by usual:

$this->library->load('history');

or via autoloader available in CI which in most cases you all will prefer.

Available metohds:

# Clear the history
$this->history->clear();

# Pushes action uri to the stack
$this->history->pushItem($actionURI);

# Retreives whole action stack
$this->history->stack();

# Returns previous URI (can be called couple of times (ie. to get the uri executed 2 actions before ))
$this->history->previous();



# INSTALLATION AND USAGE
Just put Library.php file under application/libraries and load in whenever it's needed.
